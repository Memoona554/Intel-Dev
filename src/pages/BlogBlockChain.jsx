                    <h1 className='font-bold'>What is Blockchain?</h1>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof recording of transactions across a network of computers. At its core, blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. These blocks or sections are cryptographically linked to each other, forming a continuous and immutable record of data.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Key Components of Blockchain include:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>1. Decentralization</h1>
                    <p>
                        As compared to traditional centralized systems where a single authority controls the data, blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers or nodes, which ensures that no single entity has complete control over the blockchain. This enhances transparency and reduces the risk of manipulation or fraud.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>2. Cryptographic Hashing </h1>
                    <p>
                        Each block in the blockchain is linked to the previous block through a cryptographic hash function. This hashing process generates a unique identifier for each block, making it virtually impossible to alter the data within a block without affecting the entire chain.

                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>3. Consensus Mechanism  </h1><br />
                    <p>
                        Blockchain networks rely on consensus mechanisms to validate and confirm transactions. Different blockchain platforms employ various consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), to achieve agreement among network participants on the validity of transactions.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>4. Immutability</h1><br />
                    <p>
                        Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain and confirmed by the network, it becomes virtually immutable. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that past transactions cannot be altered or deleted, providing a tamper-proof and auditable record of data.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h1 className='font-bold'>How Blockchain in Supply Chain Works?</h1><br />
